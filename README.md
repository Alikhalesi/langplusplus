# lang++
lang++ is a collection of code editing tools with support for non-English languages.

Most, if not all, of the world's widely-used programming languages are English-based, making it difficult for many non-English speakers to learn to code. Since computer knowledge and programming skills are becoming increasingly valuable in today's world, the lack of support for other languages puts non-English speakers at a disadvantage.

As of now, lang++ supports one language-programming language combination (Chinese-C++). Currently working to increase number of languages, improve the use of links to external resources, and integrate machine learning to to provide better assistance to user.
