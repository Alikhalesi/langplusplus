## ‚úîÔ∏è Purpose

Programming has become an extremely valuable skill worldwide. However, most widely-used programming languages are English-based, making the learning process difficult for many non-English speakers intending to use these languages in their studies and/or careers. lang++ addresses this issue using the translation functionality shown above.

## ü•Ö Goals

 * Expand language-programming language translation database
   * As of now, lang++ supports 2 lang-prog lang combinations (Chinese and Spanish to C++)
 * Incorporate machine learning
    * Improve translation accuracy
    * Consider context when suggesting autocompletions
    
See [issues](https://github.com/fibanneacci/langplusplus/issues) for detailed tasks and descriptions.
