### How to Contribute

#### Code

We are primarily working on the points listed above, in order to ensure that lang++ runs more smoothly. We are also working on making the online editor demo more user-friendly. These involve HTML/CSS/JavaScript expertise to improve the demo, as well as machine learning knowledge to improve aspects such as autocompletion.
If you find any bugs or potential improvements, please open an issue or pull request.

#### Translations

lang++ currently has 1 language-programming language combination. If you are familiar with any languages (other than English) and programming languages for which translation files have not already been created, please upload a new file (in .csv format) in the "translations" folder.
In addition, feel free to collaborate with others working on the same language files as you to improve existing translations.
